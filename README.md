# Prevent_From_Becoming_AFK
A simple batch and PowerShell script that prevents windows from becoming inactive by simulating user input. Helps fight against unecessary security policy which forces your computer to go to sleep and forces AFK status on social applications.

1. Simply execute "run.bat" and the script will simulate the NUMLOCK keyboard key being clicked on a random interval less than 5 minutes.
